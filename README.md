I have no idea how to manage a project like this. [Here's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrTgTDHCtLkmovA93vDOiS0uyBnXXW4zY6GRteaJy_I) a Google Sheet planning document. I think that should work for now. Please yell at me if you want edit access to anything or if I'm generally doing this wrong.
